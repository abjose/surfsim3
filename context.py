    """ NOTES
    NOTE: Potentially Contexts could have init_lists too? And this is what would
          allow you to connect things/construct circuits from a saved string?
          Seems slightly inelegant...also might be harder to 'insert' something
          into node graph?
    TODO: Be nice if could reference names like "a.b.c.d" relative to current
          lvl, or root.a.b.c.d... for absolute. And would throw an error or
          something if refer to non-unique things? or could just select all 
          matching things...
          To do this could probably add some function to make the ncessary 
          constraint with...like parses on '.' and makes sure each 'parent' is
          correct.
    TODO: For the functions that are assumed to take self.focus, could add
          *args for optionally specifying constraints
    TODO: Might be useful to allow something like "get_constraints" and could
          attempt to connect something and would return a set of appropariate 
          constraints...so users could just connect things in GUI and then
          would properly add constraints so things could be copied...
          I think this ^ would be the same as connect(root, root)
    TODO: Also have "global connect" thing where everything is told to connect
          with everything? and presumably only 'correct' connections happen.
    TODO: Add a context version of filter_nodes that takes *args?
    TODO: Would things be easier if even stored rules just as strings, and only
          'evaluate' when you actually needed them? Then probably wouldn't need
          objects for these things at all.
    TODO: consider having all rules added in a single call to add_rule be ANDed
          together in a single constraint, and then every separate call to 
          add_rule is ORed.
    TODO: Having list of batches seems inelegant (also inelegant for 
          initializing in node. Take advantage of dict-ness to never keep track
          of existing batches? (...or batch order...?)
    TODO: Are there potentially multiple connections / serious inefficiency in 
          connect when, say, trying to connect thresh to feedback? Does
          it get all threshes and all feedbacks and try to connect all multiple
          times?
    TODO: When you don't initialize before, seems like no copies are made...
