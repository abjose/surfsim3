need to be able to specify stuff for 
connect_to, connect_from
pre_init, post_init 
interact, update
really need all of these?

hmm, could have specific parts of markup language for making things like distributors, etc?

NODE name=photoreceptor
     UPDATE.......
     CONNECT TO node(name=poop, closer_than=10, self_cx_less_than=3)
     this ^ seems a bit silly, how to make easy to pass simple functions?
     DISTRIBUTE 

or 
<node>
	asdfasdf
</node>


DISTRIBUTION name=gridlike
